## Weights
Download the weight (.pt) file from the [Weights & Metrics](https://github.com/muhd-umer/pyramidtabnet/tree/relocation#weights--metrics) section and place it in this directory for a streamlined evaluation of scripts.
Alternatively, execute `get_weights.sh` from the parent directory. Example usage:

```powershell
bash weights/get_weights.sh
